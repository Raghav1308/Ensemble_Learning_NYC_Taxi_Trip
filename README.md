# Ensemble_Learning_NYC_Taxi_Trip

Project: Building Basic predictive models over the NYC Taxi Trip dataset. 
We are provided with the NYC Taxi Trip Dataset. This dataset contains information about the taxi trips that took place in different parts of New York City and how much time did that trip take to complete. 
In this project, the following are the tasks we have to complete: 
1. Building a K-Nearest neighbours model for the given dataset and find the best value of K. 
2. Building a Linear model for the given dataset with regularisation. 
3. Building a Random Forest model for the given dataset. 
4. Building a Gradient Boosting model for the given dataset. 
5. Combining all the models above using the averaging technique to generate the final predictions.
